| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Bubble look (_3a_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Nice translucent look | 10 |  |
| **Bubble motion (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Decent adjustments for a more “bubbly” feel. | 30 |  |
| **Bubble creation (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Multitouch supported, but does not change created-bubble size as the finger drags across. There is code that appears intended to support this but it is incorrectly written. | 10 | Bubble size can’t be controlled |
| **Bubble inflation/deflation (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Tapping with large jumps in size does not map well to a mental model of “inflation.” As implemented, it is no longer able to move bubbles around manually because they now react solely by jumping in size. (original bubbles can still move but that is pointless if new one’s can’t) | 15 | Only “original” bubbles can be moved, and only initially; tap-only design choice does not map to inflation |
| **Bubble popping/deletion (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Works as specified, although no feedback is given when a bubble is about to “pop.” A little signal that “one more click will end me” (red boundary? red color? throbbing animation?) would give the user a full picture of the state of things. | 8 | No feedback when close to popping |
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | Jenkins green |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 85 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | last commit 1 day after due date |  |  |
|  |  | **73** | **Total** |
